        Dark Crystal - Gelfling
    Basic mod for what will hopefully become a series of mods tributing Jim Henson's The Dark 
    Crystal. So far it only contains a general race that is the Gelfling, but there are plans
    for much more.
    
    Requires: erdelf Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 mod

    Suggested: EdB Prepare Carefully mod

    Known Probelms:
        - Portrait image has misaligned ears
        - Male Gelfling can be assigned with the Maudra/All Maudra backstory
        - Can be more than 1 All Maudra

    Future Plans:
        - Animals: Landstriders, Nebries, Garthim, Arathim, Fizgig, Hollerbats, Muski, Nurloc
        - Races: Gelfling clans, Skeksis, urRu (Mystiks), Grunak, Aughra, Podling, Lore
        - Items: Healing plants, insect meals, Gelfling essense, Crystal Shard, Firca
        - Events: restore the Crystal of Thra, Great Conjuncture, feast, Tithing
        - Biomes: Spriton Plains, Dark Wood, Highlands?, Crystal Sea, Black River, Caves of Grot
        - Misc: give girls wings, add Vliyaya (from J.M. Lee's books), 

    This is my first mod and I do not know what I am doing most of the time, but it has been fun
    so far. I would love to hear feedback on what is already here and maybe suggestions on 
    how to fix the probelms mentioned above. I am doing this in my free time, so the updates 
    may be slow, but I love the Dark Crystal and Rimworld, so they will surely happen.

    I do not claim to be an expert on Dark Crystal lore, so please correct me if anything stands
    out. 

    Disclaimer: I hope to not have offended anyone as I modeled my code after some other
    mods. I also do not own or claim anything about the Dark Crystal, it all belongs to the 
    Jim Henson Company.
